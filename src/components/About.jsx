        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Crandon Lumber</strong> is a regional supplier and exporter of
          high-quality lumber and building materials, serving Central America
          with a strong focus on reliability, compliance, and long-term partnerships.
        </p>

        <p>
          Headquartered in Guatemala City, Crandon Lumber specializes in the
          distribution and export of Southern Yellow Pine (SYP) sourced directly
          from leading sawmills in the southeastern United States. Our operations
          support key markets including El Salvador, Mexico, and neighboring
          countries, ensuring a consistent and dependable supply to meet regional
          construction and industrial demand.
        </p>

        <h3>Market Position</h3>

        <p>
          El Salvador represents a strategic growth market for Crandon Lumber.
          Supported by a dollarized economy, pro-trade policies, and the CAFTA-DR
          free trade agreement, the country offers favorable conditions for the
          import of U.S.-origin lumber. Southern Yellow Pine is particularly well
          suited to this market due to its structural strength, durability, and
          adaptability for pressure-treated applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Compliance and Trade Standards</h3>

        <p>
          Crandon Lumber operates in strict compliance with international trade,
          customs, and phytosanitary regulations. All shipments are accompanied
          by the required commercial documentation, certificates of origin, and
          USDA APHIS phytosanitary certifications, ensuring transparency and
          regulatory alignment at every stage of the supply chain.
        </p>

        <h3>Logistics and Supply Chain</h3>

        <p>
          Our logistics strategy is designed to ensure efficiency, reliability,
          and timely delivery. By partnering with experienced logistics providers
          and leveraging established regional transportation networks, we support
          distributors, contractors, and manufacturers with predictable lead times
          and consistent product availability.
        </p>

        <h3>Competitive Advantage</h3>

        <p>
          Crandon Lumber’s competitive advantage lies in its direct sourcing model.
          By purchasing Southern Yellow Pine directly from top-producing U.S.
          sawmills, we maintain full control over product quality, pricing stability,
          and supply continuity. This approach, combined with strong regional
          relationships and efficient logistics, allows us to deliver long-term
          value to our partners throughout Central America.
        </p>
