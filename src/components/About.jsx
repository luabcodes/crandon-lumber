        Headquartered in Guatemala City, Crandon Lumber specializes in the
        distribution and export of Southern Yellow Pine (SYP) sourced directly
        from leading sawmills in the southeastern United States. Our operations

      <h3 style={{ marginBottom: "1rem", color: "#1F3D2B" }}>Market Position</h3>
      <p style={{ marginBottom: "2.5rem", fontSize: "1rem", color: "#333333" }}>
        El Salvador represents a strategic growth market for Crandon Lumber.
        Supported by a dollarized economy, pro-trade policies, and the CAFTA-DR
        free trade agreement, the country offers favorable conditions for the
        import of U.S.-origin lumber. Southern Yellow Pine is particularly well
        suited to this market due to its structural strength, durability, and
        adaptability for pressure-treated applications.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ marginBottom: "1rem", color: "#1F3D2B" }}>Compliance and Trade Standards</h3>
      <p style={{ marginBottom: "2.5rem", fontSize: "1rem", color: "#333333" }}>
        Crandon Lumber operates in strict compliance with international trade,
        customs, and phytosanitary regulations. All shipments are accompanied
        by the required commercial documentation, certificates of origin, and
        USDA APHIS phytosanitary certifications, ensuring transparency and
        regulatory alignment at every stage of the supply chain.
      </p>
